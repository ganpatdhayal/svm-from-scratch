# SVM From Scratch

This repository contains **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** implementations built entirely from scratch using NumPy. No external machine learning libraries are used â€” every algorithm, optimization, and kernel function is manually coded to understand the core math behind these models.

## ðŸ’¡ What's Included

- Hard margin and soft margin SVMs
- Hinge loss optimization for non-linear classification
- Dual formulation using Lagrange multipliers
- Kernel tricks: linear, polynomial, and RBF

---

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Used

- Python (core logic)
- NumPy (array & math operations)
- CVXOPT (for quadratic programming in dual SVM)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## ðŸ”§ Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/svm-from-scratch.git
   cd svm-from-scratch
